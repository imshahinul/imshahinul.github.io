<p>For this article we are using two linked lists.</p>

{% highlight python %}
17 -> 19 -> 29 -> 43 -> 44 -> 51
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and</p>

{% highlight python %}
11 -> 21 -> 28 -> 39 -> 65
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Each of these linked lists nodes are represented with following code</p>

{% highlight python %}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
{% endhighlight %}


<p>After sorting we are going to get following result.</p>

{% highlight python %}
11 -> 17 -> 19 -> 21 -> 28 -> 29 -> 39 -> 43 -> 44 -> 51 -> 65
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Recursive Approach</h3>
<p>In this method, we'll combine two sorted linked lists using recursion. One of the simplest methods for overcoming this issue is this. The key idea behind the method is that by sending the current nodes as a parameter to the recursive function, we can keep track of the current nodes in both lists. Each time the recursive call is made, the node with the lower node value will be updated. Two lists will merge as a result of this.</p>

{% highlight python %}
class Solution:
    def merge_two_lists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # check list1 is empty, so return the list2
        if list1 is None:
            return list2
        # check list2 is empty, so return the list1
        if list2 is None:
            return list1

        # call merge_two_lists recurively
        if (list1.val < list2.val):
            list1.next = self.merge_two_lists(list1.next, list2)
            return list1
        else:
            list2.next = self.merge_two_lists(list2.next, list1)
            return list2

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Dummy node approach</h3>
<p>In this approach we will start by creating a dummy node as output of the merged linked list. The tail pointer will inititally will point to this dummy node. Eventually the tail pointer will point to end node after completing this merging process.</p>

{% highlight python %}
class Solution:
    def merge_two_lists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # list1 dummy first node to hang the result on
        dummy = ListNode()

        # points to the last result node â€” so `tail.next` is the place
        # to add new nodes to the result.
        tail = dummy

        while True:

            # if either list runs out, use the other list
            if list1 is None:
                tail.next = list2
                break
            elif list2 is None:
                tail.next = list1
                break

            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                if list1:
                    newNode = list1  # the front source node
                    list1 = list1.next  # advance the source

                    newNode.next = tail.next  # link the old dest off the new node
                    tail.next = newNode  # move dest to point to the new node

            elif list2:
                newNode = list2  # the front source node
                list2 = list2.next  # advance the source

                newNode.next = tail.next  # link the old dest off the new node
                tail.next = newNode  # move dest to point to the new node

            tail = tail.next

        return dummy.next
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In this approach we will maintain both the linked lists in decreasing order; this means both linked lists will be reversed. Then, comparing the head of each list and adding to the last of the resultant list will get the LinkedList in increasing order.</p>
