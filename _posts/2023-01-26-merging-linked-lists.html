<p>For this article we are using two linked lists.</p>

{% highlight python %}
17 -> 19 -> 29 -> 43 -> 44 -> 51
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and</p>

{% highlight python %}
11 -> 21 -> 28 -> 39 -> 65
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Each of these linked lists nodes are represented with following code</p>

{% highlight python %}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=None, next=None):
        self.val = data
        self.next = next
{% endhighlight %}


<p>After sorting we are going to get following result.</p>

{% highlight python %}
11 -> 17 -> 19 -> 21 -> 28 -> 29 -> 39 -> 43 -> 44 -> 51 -> 65
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Brute Force Method</h3>
<p>The concept is to merge both linked lists and sort the result to obtain the final output. To achieve this, the second list will be added to the end of the first list.</p>
<p>The brute force method to merge two sorted linked lists is as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Initialize two pointers, one for each linked list.</li>

    <li>Compare the data values at the current node of both linked lists, and the node with the smaller value will be
        added to the resultant linked list.
    </li>

    <li>Move the pointer to the next node of the linked list from which the node was added.</li>

    <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until both linked lists have been traversed.</li>

    <li>If one of the linked lists has been traversed and there are still elements in the other linked list, add the
        remaining elements of the linked list to the resultant linked list.
    </li>

    <li>Return the resultant linked list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a sample implementation in Python:</p>

{% highlight python %}
def merge_linked_lists(head1, head2):
    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy
    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val < head2.val:
            tail.next = head1
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            tail.next = head2
            head2 = head2.next
        tail = tail.next
    tail.next = head1 or head2
    return dummy.next

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Recursive Approach</h3>

<p>The method of merging two sorted linked lists using recursion involves sending the current nodes of both lists as parameters to a recursive function. This allows us to track the current position in both lists. Each recursive call will compare the node values and add the node with the lower value to the result. This process continues until both lists are combined into one.</p>

<p>The recursive approach to merge two sorted linked lists is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a base case, where one of the linked lists has been completely traversed and the node from the other linked list is added to the result linked list.</li>

    <li>Compare the data values at the current node of both linked lists, and the node with the smaller value will be added to the resultant linked list.</li>

    <li>Call the function recursively, with the next node of the linked list from which the node was added as the new head1 or head2.</li>

    <li>Return the resultant linked list.</li>
</ul>

Here's a sample implementation in Python:

{% highlight python %}
def merge_linked_lists(head1, head2):
    if not head1:
        return head2
    if not head2:
        return head1
    if head1.val < head2.val:
        head1.next = merge_linked_lists(head1.next, head2)
        return head1
    else:
        head2.next = merge_linked_lists(head1, head2.next)
        return head2
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Iterative merging</h3>
<p>Iterative merging of two sorted linked lists involves combining two linked lists into a single sorted linked list. The approach involves using two pointers, one for each linked list, and comparing the node values at each iteration. The node with the smaller value is added to the result linked list and the pointer is moved to the next node of the linked list from which the node was added. This process continues until both linked lists have been traversed. The result linked list is then returned. The iterative approach is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both linked lists.</p>

<p>The iterative approach to merge two sorted linked lists is as follows:</p>

<li>Create a dummy node to serve as the head of the result linked list, and a tail pointer that initially points to the dummy node.</li>

<li>While both linked lists have nodes, compare the data values at the current nodes of both linked lists.</li>

<li>The node with the smaller value will be added to the result linked list and the pointer for that linked list will move to the next node.</li>

<li>Update the tail pointer to point to the last node added to the result linked list.</li>

<li>When one of the linked lists has been completely traversed, append the remaining nodes from the other linked list to the result linked list.</li>

<li>Return the result linked list, starting from the next node after the dummy node.</li>

Here's a sample implementation in Python:

{% highlight python %}
def merge_linked_lists(head1, head2):
    dummy = ListNode()
    tail = dummy
    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val < head2.val:
            tail.next = head1
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            tail.next = head2
            head2 = head2.next
        tail = tail.next
    tail.next = head1 or head2
    return dummy.next
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Iterative In-place approach</h3>

<p>Iterative In-Place Merging of two sorted linked lists is a method of merging two linked lists into a single sorted linked list without creating a new list or allocating extra memory. Instead, the elements from one of the linked lists are inserted into the other linked list in a sorted manner.</p>

<p>The approach is as follows:</p>

<li>Initialize two pointers, one for each linked list, to keep track of the current nodes.</li>

<li>Compare the values of the current nodes of both linked lists and insert the node with the smaller value into the result linked list.</li>

<li>Move the pointer of the linked list from which the node was inserted to the next node.</li>

<li>Repeat the above steps until both linked lists have been completely traversed.</li>

<p>Here's a sample implementation in Python:</p>

{% highlight python %}
def merge_linked_lists(head1, head2):
    dummy = ListNode(-1)
    cur = dummy
    while head1 and head2:
        if head1.val < head2.val:
            cur.next = head1
            head1 = head1.next
        else:
            cur.next = head2
            head2 = head2.next
        cur = cur.next
    cur.next = head1 or head2
    return dummy.next
