<p>For this article we are using two linked lists.</p>

{% highlight python %}
17 -> 19 -> 29 -> 43 -> 44 -> 51
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and</p>

{% highlight python %}
11 -> 21 -> 28 -> 39 -> 65
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Each of these linked lists nodes are represented with following code</p>

{% highlight python %}
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
{% endhighlight %}


<p>After sorting we are going to get following result.</p>

{% highlight python %}
11 -> 17 -> 19 -> 21 -> 28 -> 29 -> 39 -> 43 -> 44 -> 51 -> 65
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Recursive Approach</h3>
<p>In this method, we'll combine two sorted linked lists using recursion. One of the simplest methods for overcoming this issue is this. The key idea behind the method is that by sending the current nodes as a parameter to the recursive function, we can keep track of the current nodes in both lists. Each time the recursive call is made, the node with the lower node value will be updated. Two lists will merge as a result of this.</p>

{% highlight python %}

def merge_two_lists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    # check list1 is empty, so return the list2
    if list1 is None:
        return list2
    # check list2 is empty, so return the list1
    if list2 is None:
        return list1

    # call merge_two_lists recurively
    if (list1.val < list2.val):
        list1.next = self.merge_two_lists(list1.next, list2)
        return list1
    else:
        list2.next = self.merge_two_lists(list2.next, list1)
        return list2

{% endhighlight %}
