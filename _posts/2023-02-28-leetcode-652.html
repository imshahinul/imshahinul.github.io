<p>The LeetCode <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-duplicate-subtrees/">problem 652</a> asks to find all duplicate subtrees in a binary tree. A subtree is any node and all its
    descendants. Two trees are considered duplicates if they have the same structure and same node values.</p>

<p>Definition for a binary tree node is following:</p>

{% highlight python %}

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

{% endhighlight %}

<p>We are going to use postorder traversal to encode each subtree as a string and keeps track of the frequency of
    each subtree using a counter. The encoding of each subtree is done by concatenating the node value with the
    postorder traversal of its left and right subtrees, separated by a special character, such as "#".</p>

<p>The postorder traversal visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root. So, for each subtree,
    the function recursively visits its left and right subtrees, and then concatenates their encoded values with the
    node value to form the encoded string for the entire subtree.</p>

<p>Once an encoded subtree is constructed, it is added to the counter, and if its frequency reaches 2, it means that
    there is a duplicate subtree. In this case, the function appends the root of the subtree to the output list.</p>

<p>Finally, the function returns the list of roots of all duplicate subtrees found.</p>

<p>Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because the
    encoding and counting of each subtree takes O(n) time, and there can be at most n subtrees in the tree. However, the
    space complexity is O(n), which is used to store the encoded strings and the counter.</p>

class Solution:
    def findDuplicateSubtrees(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[Optional[TreeNode]]:
        out = []
        count = Counter()

        def postorder(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
            if not root:
                return ''

            encoded = str(root.val) + '#' + postorder(root.left) + '#' + postorder(root.right)
            count[encoded] += 1
            if count[encoded] == 2:
                out.append(root)
            return encoded

        postorder(root)
        return out
