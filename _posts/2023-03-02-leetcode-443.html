<p>The problem asks to compress the given list of characters in-place by replacing consecutive repeated characters with
    their count. For example, the input list ["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"] should be compressed to ["a", "2", "b",
    "2", "c", "3"] and the function should return the length of the compressed list.</p>

<p>Lets implement a two-pointer approach to solve the problem. The variable l is used to keep track of
    the start of a group of consecutive characters, and the variable m is used to find the end of the group. The
    variable s keeps track of the current index where the compressed characters are being stored.</p>

{% highlight python %}

...
l, s, n = 0, 0, len(chars)
...

{% endhighlight %}

<p>The solution iterates through the characters using a while loop until l reaches the end of the list. It then finds
    the end of the current group of consecutive characters using the inner while loop. It then stores the current
    character at index l and increments s by 1.</p>

{% highlight python %}

...
while l < n:
    m = l + 1
    while m < n and chars[m] == chars[l]:
        m += 1
    chars[s] = chars[l]
    s += 1
...

{% endhighlight %}

<p>If the length of the current group is greater than 1, it converts the count of consecutive characters to a string and
    stores each digit in the compressed list, incrementing s after each digit.</p>

{% highlight python %}

...
if m - l > 1:
    cnt = str(m - l)
    for c in cnt:
        chars[s] = c
        s += 1
...

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Finally, the solution updates the value of l to the index where the next group of consecutive characters starts and
    returns the value of s, which is the length of the compressed list.</p>

{% highlight python %}

...
    l = m
return s
...

{% endhighlight %}

<p>So, the complete solution is like following:</p>

{% highlight python %}

class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        l, s, n = 0, 0, len(chars)
        while l < n:
            m = l + 1
            while m < n and chars[m] == chars[l]:
                m += 1
            chars[s] = chars[l]
            s += 1
            if m - l > 1:
                cnt = str(m - l)
                for c in cnt:
                    chars[s] = c
                    s += 1
            l = m
        return s
