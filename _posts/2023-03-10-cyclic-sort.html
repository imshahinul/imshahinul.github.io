title: "Understanding cycle sort and implement this technique to solve related Leetcode problems"
subtitle: "Cyclic sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that can be used to sort arrays containing elements from a known range. This algorithm is particularly useful when the array has elements that are known to be in a small range, such as when the array contains integers between 1 and n, where n is the length of the array."

<p>The basic idea behind cycle sort is to iterate over the array and place each element in its correct position. The
    algorithm works by repeatedly iterating over the array and swapping elements until each element is in its correct
    position. The algorithm starts by placing the first element in its correct position, which is at index 0. It then
    moves to the next element and places it in its correct position, which is at index 1. This process is repeated until
    all elements are in their correct positions.</p>

<p>To implement cycle sort, we start by iterating over the array and swapping elements until each element is in its
    correct position. The algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Start by initializing a variable called i to 0.</li>

    <li>While i is less than the length of the array, do the following:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if the element at index i is in its correct position. If it is, increment i and continue to the next
            iteration of the loop.
        </li>

        <li>If the element at index i is not in its correct position, swap it with the element at the index where it
            belongs. For example, if the element at index i should be at index j, swap the elements at indices i and j.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once all elements are in their correct positions, the array is sorted.</li>

</ul>
<p>Cyclic sort has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because each element is
    swapped at most once, and the number of swaps is at most n-1. In addition, the algorithm requires only a constant
    amount of additional memory, making it very space-efficient.</p>

<p>In conclusion, cycle sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that can be used to sort arrays containing
    elements from a known range. It is particularly useful when the array contains integers between 1 and n, where n is
    the length of the array. It has a time complexity of O(n) and requires only a constant amount of additional memory,
    making it a space-efficient algorithm.</p>

    n = len(arr)

        while pos != i:
            pos = i
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                    pos += 1
            while arr[i] == arr[pos]:

            arr[i], arr[pos] = arr[pos], arr[i]

    return arr

<p>The cycle_sort function takes an unsorted array as its parameter and returns the sorted array. The algorithm works by
    traversing the array and moving each element to its correct position. To find the correct position of an element,
    the algorithm searches for the smallest element that is greater than the current element. Once the correct position
    is found, the current element is swapped with the element at its correct position. The algorithm then moves the
    element at the correct position to its own correct position. This process is repeated until all elements are in
    their correct positions.</p>

<p>The time complexity of cyclic sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, but it has a better best-case and average-case time
    complexity of O(n). This makes it a good choice when the array contains elements that are mostly in their correct
    positions. Cyclic sort is also an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only a constant amount of
    additional memory.</p>

<p>Now let's look at some Leetcode problems which can be solved using cycle sort technique.</p>

<h3><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/">268. Missing Number</a></h3>

<p>This problem requires us finding the missing number from an array of n distinct numbers in the range of 0 to n.</p>

<p>First iterate over the input array nums using a while loop and swap the current number with the number at its correct
    position until all the numbers are at their correct position. The correct position of the number i is at the index
    i, so the correct variable is assigned to nums[i]. If the current number is less than n and not already at its
    correct position, it is swapped with the number at its correct position.</p>

<p>Once all the numbers are at their correct position, iterate over the array again to find the first index i where
    nums[i] is not equal to i. This index i is the missing number as all other numbers are at their correct position,
    and this number is not present in the array.</p>

<p>If all the numbers are in their correct position, the missing number is n, which is returned in the last line of the
    function.</p>

<p>Overall, the solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses a constant amount
    of extra space for the variables i and correct.</p>

    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i, n = 0, len(nums)
        while i < n:
            correct = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < n and nums[i] != nums[correct]:
                nums[i], nums[correct] = nums[correct], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != i:
                return i
        return n

<h3><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/">448. Find All Numbers Disappeared
    in an Array</a></h3>

<p>The idea is to place each number in its correct position, such that if the array contains no missing numbers, the ith
    number will be placed in the ith index. If there are missing numbers, some indices will be empty. By iterating
    through the array, we can find the missing numbers in the array.</p>

<p>Here's how the solution works:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Let's initialize a variable called i to 0.</li>
    <li>While i is less than the length of the array, check if the number at the current index i is in its correct
        position by comparing it to the number at index nums[i]-1.
    </li>
    <li>If the numbers are not the same, swap the numbers at indices i and nums[i]-1 to place the number in its
        correct position.
    </li>
    <li>If the numbers are the same, increment i to move to the next index.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 2-4 until iterated through the entire array.</li>
    <li>Create an empty list called disappeared_nums to store the missing numbers.</li>
    <li>Iterate through the array to find the indices that are empty (i.e., the numbers that are not in their correct
        positions).
    </li>
    <li>For each index that is empty, append the corresponding missing number to the disappeared_nums list by adding 1
        to the index.
    </li>
    <li>The return the disappeared_nums list containing all the missing numbers in the array.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using this approach, the problem can be solved with a time complexity of O(n) and use constant extra space.</p>

<h3><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/">287. Find the Duplicate Number
</a></h3>

<p>To implement the cycle sort technique for this problem, we can iterate through the array and for each number, we swap it with the number that should be at its position. We keep swapping until we either encounter the duplicate number or the number at the current position is already in its correct position.</p>

{% highlight python %}

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            while nums[i] != i + 1:
                if nums[nums[i]-1] == nums[i]:
                    return nums[i]
                else:
                    nums[nums[i]-1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]

{% endhighlight %}

<p>In the code, we first initialize the length of the array as n. We then iterate through the array using the index i.</p>

<p>For each element at index i, we check if it is in its correct position (i.e., if the element is i+1). If it is not in its correct position, we swap it with the element that should be at its position (i.e., the element at index nums[i]-1). We continue swapping until either we find the duplicate number or the element at the current position is already in its correct position.</p>

<p>The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).</p>


<h3><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/">442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
</a></h3>

<p>In this problem, we can use cyclic sort to place each number in its correct position, i.e., the number x should be at
    index x - 1. After cyclic sort, all the duplicate numbers will be grouped together, and the first occurrence of each
    duplicate number will be at its correct position. Therefore, we can iterate through the array and check which
    numbers are not at their correct position, and these are the duplicate numbers.</p>
<p>The code starts by initializing the length of the array n and an index i to 0. In each iteration of the while loop,
    we get the correct index correct of the current number nums[i] by subtracting 1, i.e., correct = nums[i] - 1. If the current
    number is not in its correct position, we swap it with the number at its correct position by setting nums[i] and
    nums[correct] to each other's values. Otherwise, we increment i to move on to the next number.</p>
<p>After the cyclic sort, we iterate through the array and append the duplicates to a list. We can identify the
    duplicate numbers by checking which numbers are not at their correct position, i.e., nums[i] != i + 1.</p>
<p>Finally, we return the list of duplicate numbers.</p>

                nums[i], nums[correct] = nums[correct], nums[i]

<p>To solve this problem using cycle sort technique lets sort the list by swaping each element to its correct position
